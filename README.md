# <em>PrNet</em>: A Neural <em>Net</em>work for Correcting <em>P</em>seudo<em>r</em>anges to Improve Positioning with Android Raw GNSS Measurements
PrNet is a neural network ü§ñ for correcting pseudoranges to improve positioning with Android üì± raw GNSS üõ∞Ô∏è measurements. This repository includes the preprocessing code, the code of PrNet, and the evaluation data set. 

## Preprocessing Android Raw GNSS Measurements (Coming soon)
The preprocessing code (MATLAB) is based on Google's open-source [gnss measurement tools](https://github.com/google/gps-measurement-tools). Through preprocessing, we extract input features as well as label the training data. Compared to Google's original code, we add more functionalities, including:
* Moving horizon estimation-based positioning
* Extended Kalman filter-based positioning
* Rauch‚ÄìTung‚ÄìStriebel (RTS) smoother-based positioning

üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª The code is put under PrNet/Preprocessing.
* Set the directory of your Android raw GNSS data file in ProcessGnssMeasScriptPrNet.m, e.g.:
      
      `dirName ='../Data/GSDC2021/Route1/2020-05-29-US-MTV-1'`;
* Specify the name of your Android raw GNSS data file in ProcessGnssMeasScriptPrNet.m, e.g.:

      `prFileName = 'Pixel4_GnssLog.txt'`;
* Specify the name of the ground truth data file, e.g.:

      `gtNmeaFileName = 'SPAN_Pixel4_10Hz.nmea'`;
* Run ProcessGnssMeasScriptPrNet.m to process Android raw GNSS measurements;
* More details can be found in [gnss measurement tools](https://github.com/google/gps-measurement-tools). 

Then, the processed files contain the input features and labels and can be found in the directory you just set. While one of them has a header, the other one only consists of data. For example:

      `SvPVT3D_Error_label_dynamic_2020-05-29-US-MTV-1.csv` with a header
      `SvPVT3D_Error_label_dynamic_data_2020-05-29-US-MTV-1.csv` without headers
